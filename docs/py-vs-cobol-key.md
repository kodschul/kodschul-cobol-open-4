# Python vs COBOL: A Practical Comparison

If you're coming from Python and want to get started with COBOL, here's a practical comparison to help you understand the key differences:

## 1. Syntax and Structure

**Python:**

- Uses indentation for code blocks
- Dynamic typing (no need to declare variable types)
- Case-sensitive language
- Simple, English-like syntax
- Supports object-oriented, functional, and procedural programming
- Uses colons and indentation for control structures

**COBOL:**

- Uses fixed format with specific columns for different elements
- Strongly typed (must declare variable types)
- Case-insensitive language
- Verbose, English-like syntax designed for business applications
- Primarily procedural programming^
- Uses explicit scope terminators (END-IF, END-PERFORM)

## 2. Data Types and Variables

**Python:**

- Basic types: int, float, str, bool, list, dict, tuple, set
- Variables declared by assignment: x = 10
- Dynamic memory allocation
- Supports complex data structures like nested dictionaries

**COBOL:**

- Basic types: PIC 9 (numeric), PIC X (alphanumeric), PIC S (signed)
- Variables declared in DATA DIVISION with level numbers
- Fixed memory allocation
- Uses group items for complex structures

## 3. Control Structures

**Python:**

- if/elif/else for conditionals
- for and while loops
- List comprehensions
- Break and continue statements
- With statement for context management

**COBOL:**

- IF/ELSE/END-IF for conditionals
- PERFORM for loops
- EVALUATE for case-like statements
- GO TO for unconditional branching
- No direct equivalent of list comprehensions

## 4. File Handling

**Python:**

- Simple file operations with open()
- Context managers for automatic file closing
- Various modes: 'r', 'w', 'a', 'rb', 'wb'
- Built-in CSV and JSON modules

**COBOL:**

- File handling in ENVIRONMENT DIVISION
- SELECT and ASSIGN clauses for file definition
- OPEN, READ, WRITE, CLOSE statements
- Sequential, indexed, and relative file organizations

## 5. Advanced Features

**Python:**

- Extensive standard library
- Third-party package ecosystem (PyPI)
- Decorators and generators
- Exception handling with try/except
- Metaprogramming capabilities

**COBOL:**

- Built-in support for decimal arithmetic
- Strong support for business applications
- COPY statement for code reuse
- CALL statement for subprograms
- Limited exception handling (ON SIZE ERROR, etc.)

## 6. Development Environment

**Python:**

- Interactive REPL for testing
- Rich IDE support (PyCharm, VSCode)
- Package management with pip
- Unit testing framework
- Debugging with pdb

**COBOL:**

- Typically compiled with COBOL compilers
- Mainframe development environments
- Debugging through compiler tools
- Limited interactive development
- Batch processing oriented
